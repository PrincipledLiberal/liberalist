# Detailed Principles

What is Enlightenment Liberalism?

The enlightenment occurred in Europe between the 17th and 19th century.
Rather than accepting as true the dogma from traditional authorities such as the church and monarchy,
individuals with no such authority could use logic, reason, and evidence, to determine the nature of reality.

Enlightenment liberalism is that subset of the enlightenment that prioritized individual freedom,
leading to ideas of individual autonomy, rule of law by consent of the governed, self government, free expression,
protection from arbitrary authority, and freedom of action that does not infringe on the freedom of others.     

While many liberal ideas pre-dated the enlightenment and did not even originate from enlightenment thinkers,
it is the undermining of church and monarchal authority,
along with the spreading of ideas outside of established institutions,
that sets this time period apart.   

While advocates for enlightenment liberalism (liberalists) can disagree on a great many topics,
we all value individuals freely expressing their ideas, no matter how disagreeable, 
and applying reason, evidence, logic, and facts to resolve our differences in civil debate.
No liberalist would try to deplatform, hecklers veto, or censor an idea, no matter how much we disagree with it.
However, criticism, ridicule, and even trolling are fair game, so long as we respond to bad ideas with better ideas, not violence.  

Here is an attempt to summarize liberalist principles by breaking the philosophy down into easily understandable parts.

### Definitions within the context of liberalism
- Moral Agency
    - The capacity to understand the nature and consequences of ones actions.
      Only those with moral agency can be held to account for their actions.
- Citizen
    - A native or naturalized person who owes allegiance to a government and is entitled to protection from it
- Individual/Person/People
    - Citizens with moral agency
- State
    - A compulsory political organization with a centralized government that maintains a monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a certain geographical territory
- Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy (using definitions from Thomas Hobbs' Leviathan)
    - Monarchy: 1 person votes
    - Aristocracy: Some people vote
    - Democracy: All people vote (includes pure democracy and representative systems)
- Constitution
    - Protects individuals from the state.
      Defines the powers and duties of the state, and limits those powers to guarantee rights of the citizens.
- Rights
    - Liberalists recognize negative rights, individual rights, and natural rights.
      The concept of positive rights is rejected, we would call these privileges.
      The concept of group rights is rejected.
      Rights are inherent and inalienable to all beings with moral agency, they are not granted by government.
- Negative rights
    - Negative rights oblige inaction from others
- Positive rights
    - Positive rights oblige action from others
- Individual rights
    - Liberalists just call these "rights", they are not subject to being voted away by a majority
- Group rights
    - This type of right is considered a contradiction in terms, groups can not have rights.
      Individuals may voluntarily join groups for access to privileges granted by that group,
      but no group may force an individual to remain part of that group.  
- Natural rights
    - Rights are not determined by human laws, they are universal and inalienable.
      They are inherent and can not be granted by government,
      although government may justly restrain individuals from interfering with the rights of others. 

### Top ten summary

- Individual Rights
    - Protecting the rights of the individual must be the highest value of society, to foster mutual tolerance and respect towards the cultivation of the dignity of every person.
- Freedom of speech
    - Freedom of expression is a necessary and fundamental pillar of a free society.
- Economic Freedom
    - Property rights that begin with personal self-ownership and private property creates the most productive societies.
- Democracy
    - Constitutional democracy is the best way for a free citizenry to maintain a state and resist tyranny.
- Self-reliance
    - People possess agency and should be treated as such because treating people like victims becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- Blind Justice
    - Each individual should be governed by the same laws as their peers without arbitrary discrimination and be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a fair trial.
- Secularism
    - Everybody is free to practice their religion, or not, as long as it does not interfere with the rights of others.
- Subsidiarity
    - To be effective in practice, the state must be run by democratically elected representatives, where balancing individual freedoms against each other is resolved at the most local practical level.
- Objective Truth
    - Policy should be based on reason, facts, logic, and evidence.  Policy should not be based on divine revelation, inherited authority, subjective experience that is not representative, or archaic traditions that have outlived their relevance.
- Citizenship
    - The state is obligated to protect the freedom of, at a minimum, all who possess moral agency who were born an raised within the borders of the state.

### Objective Truth
- There exists a single objective reality
- Truth is discoverable by facts, reason, logic, and evidence.
- Truth is in principle, discoverable by any individual without need for authorities, sacred texts, tradition, orthodoxy, or dogma.
- The fact of the matter is dictated by the nature of reality, 
  and while some truths are so complicated it takes specialized expertise to understand them,
  experts are not authorities regarding what is true,
  they just happen to be more capable of discovering what is true.
- Experts are just as vulnerable to bias as anyone,
  so for complicated topics,
  it takes many experts of different initial perspectives to reliably know what is true.
- It is logically impossible to have direct knowledge of what is true,
  so the best we can do is to adopt ideas as provisionally true while we maintain certainty proportional to evidence.
  As we test our understanding,
  knowledge does have an overall tendency towards being less wrong in the long run,
  is spite of relatively brief periods of regressions caused by individual, collective, or systemic bias.  
- While it is true that subjective experience exists,
  a single persons lived experience can't, on its own, be taken as representative.
  Government policy must be based on what is objectively true.
  It is beyond the scope of government to make policy decisions based on what individuals subjectively feel is true.
- If the truth is not on your side, you are on the wrong side.
- Enlightenment Liberalism in practice is a difficult balancing act between giving individuals as much freedom as possible,
  while at the same time preventing them from using that freedom to deny the freedom of others.
- While many of these ideas pre-date the enlightenment, what made this time period significant was rejection of authority of the monarchy and the church as the definitive sources of what is true.
  Instead, truth could be derived from nature itself through reason and evidence, and all truth claims are subject to individual scrutiny regardless of authority.    
- Good ideas can be supported by reason and evidence.  To compel someone to change their mind by force, no matter how dangerous or wrong we think their idea is, is to admit we have lost the argument.  Instead, either come up an argument so good we can marginalize their idea through ridicule, or realize that in this case we were the ones in the wrong.
- Challenge ideas to be expressed in terms of facts, reason, logic, and evidence, be suspicious of ideas expressed through substanceless emotion, dogma, sophistry, authority, or character attacks.
- Separate the idea from the person, try to win others to your side rather than vilifying them.
- Oppose bad ideas, not the people who hold them.  Attempt to convince, never compel, the victims of bad ideas.
- Embrace your diversity of biases as an essential tool for determining what is true.  Ideas can be challenged, criticized, or ridiculed, but never suppressed.  To suppress ideas we might disagree with is to enslave our minds to a prison of orthodoxy.  
- We are ill-equipped to defend our own ideas if we are not exposed to opposing ideas, so we actively seek to understand those we disagree with.  In this manner we can strengthen our good ideas, and hope our opponents will make us aware of any bad ideas we are infected with.
- Don’t seek facts just to fit a narrative of what we want reality to be, we try to accept reality as it is so that we may better understand how to improve individual freedom in practice rather than only in theory.
- The existence of objective reality is self evident.  Utopian visions that require the rejection of objective truth in favor of subjective opinion, lived experience, personal revelation, and so on may sound good, but only because they have sheided themselves from critical examination.  Their reality would be much different.
- Bigotry is stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one’s own.  Calling it “political correctness” does not change what it is.
- Identity politics are an enemy to universal principles and reason.  Any statement is just as true or false when uttered “as a” member of an identity group as it would be when uttered by any other person.  Principles of freedom apply to all individuals regardless of their identity

### Individual Freedom
- Liberalism is the ideology that every other ideology comes running to when they are the ones being oppressed. 
- Individual rights apply to every citizen of a state with moral agency.
- Moral agency is the capacity to be held accountable for one's actions.
- Natural rights are not granted by the state.
  They are universal and inalienable.
  The state is responsible for protecting the natural rights of its citizens. 
- The state has full sovereignty to determine immigration policy and path to citizenship.
- Natural rights are exclusively negative rights, that is,
  they oblige that others do not interfere with your rights,
  but they do not create obligation of others to take action for your benefit.
- Natural rights include the right to life, liberty, property, and speech.
  Natural rights also include freedom of action that does not interfere with the rights of others.
- Every individual has sovereignty of body
- Every individual has sovereignty of mind
- Individuals should be tolerated to the extent they don't interfere with the autonomy of others,
  but demanding respect is an imposition.
  Respect should be earned by negotiation between individuals, not enforced by state mandate.
- Individual freedom is an end, not something that can be sacrificed as a means to achieve something else.
- Every right entails a corresponding responsibility not to deny that right to others.
- Strong government, narrowly focused.  The state must be strong enough to protect individual liberty.  While at the same time limited in scope such that it can not threaten individual freedom.
- The state must not let another entity become strong enough that it could usurp the state and threaten individual freedom.
- The state must not delegate creation, interpretation, or enforcement of laws to any entity outside of the state.
- A state must be accountable to the people through some form of constitutional democracy.  The constitution must protect against tyranny of the majority and government overstepping its scope.  Democracy can be pure or take a representational form, so long as the people have the authority to remove government officials at their pleasure.  Democracy (everyone votes), is in contract to Aristocracy (some people vote), and Monarchy (one person votes).
- Every right comes with a corresponding responsibility not to deny that right of others.
- The state must protect both freedom of religion and freedom from religion, and may not favor one belief about religion over another.
- To be effective in practice, the state must be run by democratically elected representatives, where balancing individual freedoms against each other is resolved at the most local practical level.
- Subsidiarity, Social and political issues should be dealt with at the most local level that is consistent with their resolution.
- The state must be both strong enough to responsibly guard freedom against outside threats and preserve its own existence, yet also as small as possible to guard against corruption from the inside.
- To ensure citizens make informed decisions in democratic elections, the freedom of expressing any idea must be absolute and protected by the state.  This protection includes preventing non-government entities from using real life consequences to suppress speech.
- Economic freedom is required not only as a matter of principle, but it is also necessary to maintain a self reliant, educated, and prosperous citizenry that can afford the effort it takes to democratically keep the state from abusing power. 
- Unequal amounts of prosperity granted by the free market are a necessary and desirable consequence of individuals having the freedom to choose the level of innovation, effort, and risk they are willing to contribute to society.
- Racism is the idea that someone should be treated as inferior or superior based on race alone rather than merit. Anyone is equally capable of being racist regardless of their power or privilege.
- Individuals should be judged by their actions, not their presumed motives.  Acting like you can read minds is arrogance.
- Treating a “hate crime” differently than a “crime” demonstrates government overreach from legitimate protective use of force, to the tyrannical criminalization of thought.  The crime is the action that actually affected a victim, the thought behind the crime harmed no one.  Thought should never be criminalized.
- If there is no victim there can be no crime.  An informed choice affecting only one’s self does not have a victim.  To criminalize a “vice” is to oppose freedom.
- Opposing hate speech is opposing speech itself.  Speech must be free regardless of its motivation.  Do do otherwise would allow ANY speech to be censored by falsely claiming hateful motivation.  Hate speech laws are anti-liberal because they enable state punishment of thought crime.
- Any attempt to achieve equal outcomes is an immoral attack on the concept of human agency.  Unequal outcomes are a necessary and desirable consequence of an individual’s freedom to choose the level of effort, innovation, and risk they are willing contribute to society, and they deserve to reap the rewards should others consider their productive output so exceptional that they volunteer to compensate for it.
- Individuals should be free to identify however they like, but this identity does not entitle them to privileged treatment, and individuals are free to recognize or ignore the identities of others as they choose.
- An idea is a fromulated thought or opinion, while an action is and exertion of power or force.  The freedom to express any idea is absolute, and actions are only restricted to the extent that they interfere with individual freedom of others.  Expressing an idea can not possibly be violence, no matter how hateful or untrue someone may find it.
- The pursuit of truth needs no permission or justification.  While the means of acquiring knowledge must not violate individual freedom, the possibility of discovering bad news is no excuse for ignorance.
- Take a principled stance on individual freedom, freedom should be defended even for people we despise.
- Political correctness is an affront to free speech.  Reject compelling others to speak in a certain way, or censoring ideas that are deemed offensive.
- Suppressing free speech not only victimizes the speaker, but also those who are denied the opportunity hear the speaker and decide for themselves what they think of the speech.  This true no matter how the idea is expressed, be it satire, irony, joke, metaphor, analogy, fiction, art or speaking plainly.
- People should be free to buy and sell goods at mutually acceptable terms.
- There is no problem with inequality resulting from merit.  If an individual chooses to apply their skill and creativity to provide such value to the masses that they voluntarily pay for it, that inequality is justly earned regardless of how much disparity it creates.
- Individuals should not get privileged exception from rule of law because of their religion.  The laws of the land take precedence over religious traditions.
- Political correctness is directly opposed ot liberalism.  Ideas should be judged on their merit, regardless of how offensive some may find them.
- A culture can not be appropriated.  Freedom to appreciate and participate in whatever traditions an individual chooses should  not be dependant on what culture they happened to be born into.
- Freedom of thought is absolute.  Thoughts can not be crimes.  Emotions can not be crimes.  No individuals can be justly punished for what they think, nor can they be justly made to express an idea they do not agree with.
- Being wrong can not be a crime.  While bad ideas may be held to account by presenting better ideas, no one should be punished simply for being wrong.  People willing to risk being wrong are essential to escape orthodox knowledge so presumed to be right that we don’t notice its flaws. 
- For something to be an action, it has to have a direct, objective, effect.  A behavior that is only subjectively considered harmful, should remain perfectly legal no matter how upset some individuals choose to get over it.
- Identity politics pit groups against each other in zero sum competition.  We should focus on universal interests so that we may all cooperate on promoting a future with more individual freedom and opportunity
- A free market means does not mean zero regulation.  For the market to be free, it must have a structure in place that allows buyers and sellers to reliably trade on terms both find acceptable.
- People should be treated as individuals rather than groups even if it is objectively true that there are group differences.  Groups have overlap, and the possibility of even a single exception justifies treating an individual as if they could be the exception to the rule
- Offended is not oppressed.  While government has a necessary role in protecting your freedom, it should have nothing to do with protecting your feelings.
- Collectives are tools for individuals.  Collective groups are only useful to the extent that they serve the individuals that make them up.  The needs of an individual must not be sacrificed for the good of the collective, whether they are part of it or not.
- There are many forms of censorship.  This includes by the state, heckler's veto, being deplatformed, violence, and retaliation for your views in your personal life.  Having your argument criticized, losing the argument, or having attention drawn to how ridiculous your argument is, are not forms of censorship, they are examples of the open marketplace of ideas working correctly.
- Win the argument of ideas through convincing, not compulsion.  Opposing a bad idea is not the same as opposing the individual expressing it.  Former oppressors and victims of bad ideas become the best champions of good ideas if we win them over peacefully.
- Promote ideas based on their merit.  Trying to discredit an opponent is not trying to win an argument.
- Reject the concept of justice for groups, only individuals can have justice
- The role of the state is to protect our freedom, not be our nanny.  We should treat others like adults and in turn expect others to us like adults.  Adults are able to make their own decisions and are fully capable of facing the consequences of their decisions.  Adults do not need guardans to take care of them as if they were domestic cattle.
- Promote their ideas based on merit, we have no need of an inquisition to vilify those with opposing ideas.
- It is not the role of government to provide a surrogate willpower for its citizenry.  Leave it to the citizens to decide for themselves what to think, how to think, and what is important, without manipulation from the state.
- While actions must necessarily be regulated by the state to protect individual freedom, it is never the role of the state to regulate thought and speech.
- Bad ideas can’t be challenged if they are censored.  Challenge bad ideas with better ideas, we do not help bad ideas avoid criticism by denying their opposition the opportunity to hear them.
- Treat individuals as adults.  Anyone so fragile they think they can be harmed by an idea needs therapy, not trigger warnings, safe spaces, or authoritarian censorship.
- Free speech is a necessary tool for marginalized groups to fight their oppression.  Those so marginalized that they are not even allowed to speak may be pushed to violence if they have no alternative way to express their plight.
- Individuals accountable for their own actions, not the actions of a group they happen to be part of through no fault of their own, such as race.  Holding someone accountable for an action they did not perform on account of their race is just the religious concept of original sin repackaged as an oppression narrative.
- No one should be judged for their “unconscious bias”.  Bias is not action, thoughts can not be crime, and the idea of judging someone based on an unconscious thought is reaches a level of oppression so high that even George Orwell did not predict it.
- Do not hold individuals accountable for what others do, because each individual is responsible for their own actions.  When services, technologies, platforms, or utilities are abused, the fault lies solely with the individual committing the abuse.
- Attempts to equalize prosperity irrespective of merit, such as through a planned economy, has led to authoritarianism, poverty, and starvation every time it has been tried.
- Government should be as small as possible, while still being strong enough to protect individual freedom.  A central authority should perform only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level.
- The right not to be punched in the face comes with a corresponding responsibility not to punch others in the face.  Enforcing that responsibility must be delegated to the state.  Vigilantism is an unjust use of force.
- Government by democratically elected representatives are the most just, so long as government authority is subordinate to a constitution that prevents a majority from violating the freedom of a minority.
- The citizenry should be served by government, not rendered dependant on it.  Policies that hinder self reliance are antithetical to the agency of citizens.  The state should empower individuals with the freedom to succeed to whatever level they choose to, not enact perverse incentive structures that make individuals feel more success will make their lives worse.
- Oppression is measured by how individuals are actually affected, not by their status as a minority or how they feel.   While systemic oppression should be opposed no matter which direction it comes from, perceived oppression from vague conspiratorial constructs requires therapy, not privileged treatment.
- Morality should be based on universal principles, not cultural oddities.  Cultures are not equally moral.  Any culture with practices such as using rape as a punishment, killing apostates, burning individuals for witchcraft, non-consensual body mutilation, human sacrifice, and so on, rightly deserves to be called out as barbaric and inferior.
- Rights are universally applicable to all beings with moral agency.
- The government should be for the people and by the people.  Only a democracy can justly wield power, not a monarchy or aristocracy.
- Once a goal is achieved in an area, focus on more important areas, don’t lower the standards of victimhood to justify more attention in that area.  The ability to be physically safe and freedom to choose to succeed are important, hurt feelings are a first world problem.
- Try to solve real problems that actually hinder individual freedom.  Do not promote a narrative of victimhood for its own sake, nor spend time signalling how virtuous you are.  Do not express more outrage on behalf of a group, because only individuals can be victimized, not groups.
- While it is fine to promote tolerance of other ways of living and points of view, those who force their ways of living or points of view on others, should not be tolerated.
- While government's role is protecting individual freedom, that does not mean there is anything wrong with individuals subjecting themselves to the rules of voluntary organizations.  Such an organization can still work within the bounds of liberalism as long a members of the group can leave at any time, and the rules of the organization are not interfering with the freedoms of those outside of that organization.  For example, it is a testament to the superiority of liberalism that it allows for voluntary communist communes, whereas under communism a voluntary free market could not be tolerated.
- While rights and their corresponding responsibilities apply to individuals with moral agency within the borders of the state.  Those who can’t be held to account morally, such as children and animals, can’t be expected to have the same rights, but can still have rights.  It is up to constitutional democracies to make this judgment call as best they can.
- It is a practical necessity of a government to only have jurisdiction within its own borders.  It is not the obligation of a country to force other countries to be liberal, nor is it an obligation to allow immigration of individuals from other countries.  The government is obligated to prevent a destabilizing influx of individuals from other countries that do not share liberal values.
- While fighting oppression can sometimes require specialization, oppression is not a zero sum game.  Alleviating oppression for one category does not automatically increase oppression in all others.
- Equal treatment is more important than equal outcome.  An unequal outcome could be the result of oppression, but could also be a necessary consequence of freedom.  Don’t assume oppression exists just because of unequal outcomes, especially if only one group charistic was measured.  Measure as many factors as possible, and remember that correlation does not imply causation.
