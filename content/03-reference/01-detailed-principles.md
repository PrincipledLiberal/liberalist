# Detailed Principles

What is Enlightenment Liberalism?

The enlightenment occurred in Europe between the 17th and 19th century.
Rather than accepting as true the dogma from traditional authorities such as the church and monarchy,
individuals with no such authority could use logic, reason, and evidence, to determine the nature of reality.

Enlightenment liberalism is that subset of the enlightenment that prioritized individual freedom,
leading to ideas of individual autonomy, rule of law by consent of the governed, self government, free expression,
protection from arbitrary authority, and freedom of action that does not infringe on the freedom of others.     

While many liberal ideas pre-dated the enlightenment and did not even originate from enlightenment thinkers,
it is the undermining of church and monarchal authority,
along with the spreading of ideas outside of established institutions,
that set this time period apart.   

While advocates for enlightenment liberalism (liberalists) can disagree on a great many topics,
what we share is a value for individuals freely expressing their ideas, no matter how disagreeable, 
and applying reason, evidence, logic, and facts to resolve our differences in civil debate.
No liberalist would try to deplatform, hecklers veto, or censor an idea, no matter how much we disagree with it,
but criticism, ridicule, and even trolling are fair game, so long as we respond to bad ideas with better ideas, not violence.  

Here is an attempt to summarize liberalist principles by breaking the philosophy down into easily understandable parts.

### Definitions within the context of liberalism
- Moral Agency
    - The capacity to understand the nature and consequences of ones actions.
      Only those with moral agency can be held to account for their actions.
- Citizen
    - A native or naturalized person who owes allegiance to a government and is entitled to protection from it
- Individual/Person/People
    - Citizens with moral agency
- State
    - A compulsory political organization with a centralized government that maintains a monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a certain geographical territory
- Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy
    - Monarchy: 1 person votes
    - Aristocracy: Some people vote
    - Democracy: All people vote (includes pure democracy and representative systems)
- Constitution
    - Protects individuals from the state.
      Defines the powers and duties of the state, and limits those powers to guarantee rights of the citizens.
- Rights
    - Liberalists recognize negative rights, individual rights, and natural rights.
      The concept of positive rights is rejected, we would call these privileges.
      The concept of group rights is rejected (including cultural rights and rights based on identity).
      Rights are inherent an inalienable to all beings with moral agency, they are not granted by government.

### Top ten summary

- Individual Rights
    - Protecting the rights of the individual must be the highest value of society, to foster mutual tolerance and respect towards the cultivation of the dignity of every person.
- Freedom of speech
    - Freedom of expression is a necessary and fundamental pillar of a free society.
- Economic Freedom
    - Property rights that begin with personal self-ownership and private property creates the most productive societies.
- Democracy
    - Constitutional democracy is the best way for a free citizenry to maintain a state and resist tyranny.
- Self-reliance
    - People possess agency and should be treated as such because treating people like victims becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- Blind Justice
    - Each individual should be governed by the same laws as their peers without arbitrary discrimination and be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a fair trial.
- Secularism
    - Everybody is free to practice their religion, or not, as long as it does not interfere with the rights of others.
- Subsidiarity
    - To be effective in practice, the state must be run by democratically elected representatives, where balancing individual freedoms against each other is resolved at the most local practical level.
- Objective Truth
    - Policy should be based on reason, facts, logic, and evidence.  Policy should not be based on divine revelation, inherited authority, subjective experience that is not representative, or archaic traditions that have outlived their relevance.
- Citizenship
    - The state is obligated to protect the freedom of, at a minimum, all who possess moral agency who were born an raised within the borders of the state.

### Objective Truth
- There exists a single objective reality
- Truth is discoverable by facts, reason, logic, and evidence.
- Truth is in principle, discoverable by any individual without need for authorities, sacred texts, tradition, orthodoxy, or dogma.
- The fact of the matter is dictated by the nature of reality, 
  and while some truths are so complicated it takes specialized expertise to understand them,
  experts are not authorities regarding what is true,
  they just happen to be more capable of discovering what is true.
- Experts are just as vulnerable to bias as anyone,
  so for complicated topics,
  it takes many experts of different initial perspectives to reliably know what is true.
- It is logically impossible to have direct knowledge of what is true,
  so the best we can do is to adopt ideas as provisionally true while we maintain certainty proportional to evidence.
  As we test our understanding,
  knowledge does have an overall tendency towards being less wrong in the long run,
  is spite of relatively brief periods of regressions caused by individual, collective, or systemic bias.  
- While it is true that subjective experience exists,
  a single persons lived experience can't, on its own, be taken as representative.
  Government policy must be based on what is objectively true.
  It is beyond the scope of government to make policy decisions based on what individuals subjectively feel is true.
- If the truth is not on your side, you are on the wrong side.
- Enlightenment Liberalism in practice is a difficult balancing act between giving individuals as much freedom as possible,
  while at the same time preventing them from using that freedom to deny the freedom of others.
- While many of these ideas pre-date the enlightenment, what made this time period significant was rejection of authority of the monarchy and the church as the definitive sources of what is true.
  Instead, truth could be derived from nature itself through reason and evidence, and all truth claims are subject to individual scrutiny regardless of authority.    

### Individual Freedom
- Individual rights apply to every citizen of a state with moral agency.
- Moral agency is the capacity to be held accountable for one's actions.
- Natural rights are not granted by the state.
  They are universal and inalienable.
  The state is responsible for protecting the natural rights of its citizens. 
- The state has full sovereignty to determine immigration policy and path to citizenship.
- Natural rights are exclusively negative rights, that is,
  they oblige that others do not interfere with your rights,
  but they do not create obligation of others to take action for your benefit.
- Natural rights include the right to life, liberty, property, and speech.
  Natural rights also include freedom of action that does not interfere with the rights of others.
- Every individual has sovereignty of body
- Every individual has sovereignty of mind
- Individuals should be tolerated to the extent they don't interfere with the autonomy of others,
  but demanding respect is an imposition.
  Respect should be earned by negotiation between individuals, not enforced by state mandate.
- Individual freedom is an end, not something that can be sacrificed as a means to achieve something else.
- Every right entails a corresponding responsibility not to deny that right to others.
- Strong government, narrowly focused.  The state must be strong enough to protect individual liberty.  While at the same time limited in scope such that it can not threaten individual freedom.
- The state must not let another entity become strong enough that it could usurp the state and threaten individual freedom.
- The state must not delegate creation, interpretation, or enforcement of laws to any entity outside of the state.
- A state must be accountable to the people through some form of constitutional democracy.  The constitution must protect against tyranny of the majority and government overstepping its scope.  Democracy can be pure or take a representational form, so long as the people have the authority to remove government officials at their pleasure.  Democracy (everyone votes), is in contract to Aristocracy (some people vote), and Monarchy (one person votes).
- Every right comes with a corresponding responsibility not to deny that right of others.
- The state must protect both freedom of religion and freedom from religion, and may not favor one belief about religion over another.
- To be effective in practice, the state must be run by democratically elected representatives, where balancing individual freedoms against each other is resolved at the most local practical level.
- Subsidiarity, Social and political issues should be dealt with at the most local level that is consistent with their resolution.
