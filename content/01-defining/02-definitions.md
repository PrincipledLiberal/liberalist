# Definitions

Here are some terms defined within the context of enlightenment liberalism.

- Moral Agency
    - The capacity to understand the nature and consequences of ones actions.
      Only those with moral agency can be held to account for their actions.
- Citizen
    - A native or naturalized person who owes allegiance to a government and is entitled to protection from it
- Individual/Person/People
    - Citizens with moral agency
- State
    - A compulsory political organization with a centralized government that maintains a monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a certain geographical territory
- Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy (using definitions from Thomas Hobbs' Leviathan)
    - Monarchy: 1 person votes
    - Aristocracy: Some people vote
    - Democracy: All people vote (includes pure democracy and representative systems)
- Constitution
    - Protects individuals from the state.
      Defines the powers and duties of the state, and limits those powers to guarantee rights of the citizens.
- Rights
    - Liberalists recognize negative rights, individual rights, and natural rights.
      The concept of positive rights is rejected, we would call these privileges.
      The concept of group rights is rejected.
      Rights are inherent and inalienable to all beings with moral agency, they are not granted by government.
- Negative rights
    - Negative rights oblige inaction from others
- Positive rights
    - Positive rights oblige action from others
- Individual rights
    - Liberalists just call these "rights", they are not subject to being voted away by a majority
- Group rights
    - This type of right is considered a contradiction in terms, groups can not have rights.
      Individuals may voluntarily join groups,
      but no group may force an individual to remain part of that group.  
- Natural rights
    - Rights are not determined by human laws, they are universal and inalienable.
      They are inherent and can not be granted by government,
      although government may justly restrain individuals from interfering with the rights of others.
