# Deriving Liberalism

The essence of liberalism is derivable from only two principles.
Objective truth, and individual freedom.

The idea that the existence of objective truth is self evident is not specific to liberalism, so it is not always listed among liberal values.
Rather it is a necessary condition for any idea to be internally consistent.
Truth must never be our enemy if we are to apply liberalism in practice.

Individual freedom is the ultimate goal.
To ensure one individual does not violate the freedom of another, we need rule of law.
Rule of law means everybody plays by the same rules and justice is blind to arbitrary discrimination.
We delegate authority of enforcing rule of law to the state.

A “state” is a compulsory political organization with a centralized government that maintains a monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a certain geographical territory.
For a state to be liberal, it must have a constitution that restricts the states authority to what is necessary for protecting individual sovereignty of body and mind.
From rule of law and sovereignty of mind, it follows that the state must be secular, allowing individuals both freedom of religion and freedom from religion.
To be effective in practice, the state must be run by democratically elected representatives, where balancing individual freedoms against each other is resolved at the most local practical level.
The state must be both strong enough to responsibly guard freedom against outside threats and preserve its own existence, yet also as small as possible to guard against corruption from the inside.
To ensure citizens make informed decisions in democratic elections, the freedom of expressing any idea must be absolute and protected by the state.
Economic freedom is required not only as a matter of principle, but it is also necessary to maintain a self reliant, educated, and prosperous citizenry that can afford the effort it takes to democratically keep the state from abusing power.
Unequal amounts of prosperity granted by the free market are a necessary and desirable consequence of individuals having the freedom to choose the level of innovation, effort, and risk they are willing to contribute to society.
