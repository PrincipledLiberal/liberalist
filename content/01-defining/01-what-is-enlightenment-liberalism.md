# What is Enlightenment Liberalism?

The enlightenment occurred in Europe between the 17th and 19th century.
Rather than accepting as true the dogma from traditional authorities such as the church and monarchy,
individuals with no such authority could use logic, reason, and evidence, to determine the nature of reality.

Enlightenment liberalism is that subset of the enlightenment that prioritized individual freedom,
leading to ideas of individual autonomy, rule of law by consent of the governed, self government, free expression,
protection from arbitrary authority, and freedom of action that does not infringe on the freedom of others.     

While many liberal ideas pre-dated the enlightenment and did not even originate from enlightenment thinkers,
it is the undermining of church and monarchal authority,
along with the spreading of ideas outside of established institutions,
that sets this time period apart.   

While advocates for enlightenment liberalism (liberalists) can disagree on a great many topics,
we all value individuals freely expressing their ideas, no matter how disagreeable, 
and applying reason, evidence, logic, and facts to resolve our differences in civil debate.
No liberalist would try to deplatform, hecklers veto, or censor an idea, no matter how much we disagree with it.
However, criticism, ridicule, and even trolling are fair game, so long as we respond to ideas we object to with other ideas, not violence or coercion into silence.  

In this context,
"enlightenment" refers to the idea that individuals are capable of determining what is true for themselves by applying their own reason to the available evidence,
and "liberal" refers to the idea that individuals are capable of being responsible for their own actions.
  
Citizens are to be treated like responsible adults, not coddled like children.
The state's job is to protect citizens from each other, not act as their parents.
