# Principles

- Individual Rights
    - Protecting the rights of the individual must be the highest value of society, to foster mutual tolerance and respect towards the cultivation of the dignity of every person.
- Freedom of speech
    - Freedom of expression is a necessary and fundamental pillar of a free society.
- Economic Freedom
    - Property rights that begin with personal self-ownership and private property creates the most productive societies.
- Democracy
    - Constitutional democracy is the best way for a free citizenry to maintain a state and resist tyranny.
- Self-reliance
    - People possess agency and should be treated as such because treating people like victims becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- Blind Justice
    - Each individual should be governed by the same laws as their peers without arbitrary discrimination and be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a fair trial.
- Secularism
    - Everybody is free to practice their religion, or not, as long as it does not interfere with the rights of others.
- Subsidiarity
    - To be effective in practice, the state must be run by democratically elected representatives, where balancing individual freedoms against each other is resolved at the most local practical level.
- Objective Truth
    - Policy should be based on reason, facts, logic, and evidence.  Policy should not be based on divine revelation, inherited authority, subjective experience that is not representative, or archaic traditions that have outlived their relevance.
- Citizenship
    - The state is obligated to protect the freedom of, at a minimum, all who possess moral agency who were born an raised within the borders of the state.
