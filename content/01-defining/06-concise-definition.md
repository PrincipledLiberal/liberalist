# Concise Definition

The limitations of language make it difficult to describe liberalism exhaustively, concisely, and with precision, so here are 3 attempts favoring conciseness.  I use liberal as shorthand for “enlightenment liberal”

(1) Liberalism is the razors edge between tyranny and anarchy. It is a razors edge because every freedom of action possessed by an individual can be abused to take away freedom of action of another individual. Tyranny is restricting actions that do not interfere with the freedom of others. Anarchy is not restricting actions that do interfere with the freedom of others.

(2) Imagine what you would get if you started with utilitarianism, then replaced the utility function from collective happiness to individual freedom.  It wouldn’t be the same thing as utilitarianism any more, but I think it would approximate liberalism.

(3) Liberalism is the prioritization of objective truth, then individual freedom (note the etymology of “enlightenment” and “liberal” ).  Objective truth by itself is not a liberal concept, but it is a necessary condition for liberalism because once you allow contradiction, tyrants will exploit that to claim individual freedom exists when it does not.  Individual freedom is prioritized because it uniquely accounts for humans being different and valuing different things.  If individual freedom is protected, it allows individuals to pursue what they value to the extent they can do so without hindering others from pursuing what they value.  Values that require the denial of individual freedom are considered not legitimate in a liberal society.
